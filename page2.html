	<!--BACKGROUND OF THE NOVEL-->
		<h2 id="BackgroundNovel">Background of the Novel</h2>

		<p>Noli Me Tangere, the translation of "Touch Me Not" in Latin, was written by Jose Rizal, one of the country's most significant heroes in history. Noli Me Tangere, along with El Filibusterismo, were the two novels of Rizal that were used to combat against the Spaniards during the time of the Spanish Colonization. The author started writing this novel in 1884, and he finished writing it in 1886. It was first published in Berlin the year after. The original copy was written in Spanish, and a number of authors have created versions of this novel in English and Filipino.</p>

		<p>The historical novel is relevant to this day, as it is being taught in several schools. It demonstrates to people what the Filipinos went through during the Spanish period. It also makes people aware and educated about the various social, political, and moral issues that the world faces today. Each character in the novel symbolizes a certain issue that is relevant today.</p>
